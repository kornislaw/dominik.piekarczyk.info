# Why this site

This is not exactly a blog. It's rather a scratchpad to which I come back occassionally, usually when preparing to an exam (hence I'm here).

I rather do NOT advise you to explore this blog, it's very irregular and probably chaotic. This is a list of solutions I may direct my colleagues to when they have similar challenges in the future.

### Common commands

```bash
source ../bin/activate
workon pelican
fab regenerate
make html
pelican-themes --upgrade /Users/dominik/Documents/dev/workspaces/nest-korn --verbose
make s3_upload
```
