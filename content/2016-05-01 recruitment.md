## My tech skills

### In use

### Used in the past

#### ActionScript/Flex

* [Apache Flex](http://flex.apache.org/), formerly Adobe Flex, is a software development kit (SDK) for the development
and deployment of cross-platform rich Internet applications based on the Adobe Flash platform.
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex)
    * It is a dying technology as Steve Jobs effectively killed Flash while announcing it won't be supported on mobile devices.
        * Apple's decision to abandon Flash made complete sense. The unwieldy format demanded way too much in system and
        battery resources and Adobe was unable to successfully transition it to modern mobile devices.
        [Computerworld](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2599798/apple-ios/apple-ios-how-to-run-flash-on-your-ipad-if-you-must.html)


#### Behavior-Driven Development

* Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a subset of Test-Driven Development (TDD).
* The idea is to **not only** test your code at the granular level with **unit tests**,
    **but also** test your application end to end, using **acceptance tests**.
    * Unit testing alone can not ensure the application being delivered actually provides the full functionality that is required.
    * Therefore acceptance testing adds another layer of confidence in your code to ensure that those individual 'units' fit together to deliver the full package required.
    [Tutsplus](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/behavior-driven-development-in-python--net-26547)
* The process can be simply defined as:
    * Write a failing acceptance test
    * Write a failing unit test
    * Make the unit test pass
    * Refactor
    * Make the acceptance test pass

#### Bigdata

* Big data is a term for data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate.
* Challenges include analysis, capture, data curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, querying and information privacy. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)
* Big data can be described by the following characteristics:
    * Volume - The quantity of generated and stored data. The size of the data determines the value and potential insight- and whether it can actually be considered big data or not.
    * Variety - The type and nature of the data. This helps people who analyze it to effectively use the resulting insight.
    * Velocity - In this context, the speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development.
    * Variability - Inconsistency of the data set can hamper processes to handle and manage it.
    * Veracity - The quality of captured data can vary greatly, affecting accurate analysis.

* [Kapow Katalyst used to automate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z-KytMD_Cs)
* [Competitive intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_intelligence) is the action of defining, gathering,
analyzing, and distributing intelligence about products, customers, competitors, and any aspect of the environment needed
to support executives and managers making strategic decisions for an organization.


## Answers to possible questions ##

* Why did you decide to apply to this role?
    * I am fascinated with this model "From Data to Wisdom". You start with raw data, then link pieces with relationship, therefore converting it to information. Then you recognize patterns, so you're converting it to knowledge. Then you apply the knowledge as your wisdom.
        * What's important in most cases data is out there, on the internet. It is enough to find the relevant source (or sources) and to grab it to your own database or a data lake for further analysis.
        * My current role is great, it's challenging all the time, never the same, I learn so much about the IT market. 
        * However, this is secondary research so most of the time I depend heavily on someone elses opinion. 
        * But I don't want to lean on opinions, I want to create research which outcomes are based on rock solid input.
    * This is also relevant to what I like doing in my private projects (when there are several conditions met: children asleep, not too late and I still have energy, no favorite TV series to watch, no jogging time, and my wife doesn't have other plans for my free time - I should mention this one in the first place)
        * So it's a bit challenging to develop at home. 
        * The common advice is: do at work what you like doing in your real life and get paid for it. 
        * So this is what I'd like to combine - developing skills in what interests me most and living from it.
* Why are you the best candidate for the role?
    * This is probably the most common question and one of the toughest to answer. I won't say I am the best candidate, it would be arrogant, there's a decent chance there will be someone else more qualified than me.
        * First this role is tailored to my competencies. I know how to scrape data, I know how to access APIs. Then I know how to cleanse, analyse and visualise data.
        * Second, this is what I like doing, I spend my private time on finding value in data grabbed from the internet. So I am enthusiastic about the oportunity and I will stay enthusiastic about my job.
        * If I apply for a job position, I really mean it. This is the first job interview I'm having since I started my current job 4 years ago.
        * By the way if there was someone more qualified maybe it's even better. I love working with people smarter than me, a great oportunity to learn from others all the time. And then of course I do everything to keep pace with them.



## My questions ##

* If you wanted to convince me to take this job -
    whatever your final decision will be, for a moment please act as you intent to hire me -
    what would you say? How would you advertise the role?
