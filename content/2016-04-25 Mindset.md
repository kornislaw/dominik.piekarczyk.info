* I am very inquisitive and often get excited about research findings but I also become very sceptical if I don't see enough proof in the underlying data.
* I *love* learning new things. My todo-list of textbooks and tutorials is in use every day, though never getting shorter.
  * Unlimited access to Safari Bookstore is one of the greatest benefits of my current job.
