## Why a blog?

> I'm continuously learning (and sharing it when I got it).

This is a tagline of my colleague, but I could just have the same one. 
This is one of three reasons I started this blog - I like sharing knowledge. 
It also helps me to memorize and systematize my knowledge and (which helped me several times already) to access it from anywhere.

I am not advertising this site at all, in fact this blog is now under a temporary domain, which is hard to memorize. But if you have just googled and answer for your issue - I am happy about it!

## Why a static website hosting?

See [S3 for static website hosting](/s3-for-static-website-hosting.html).

## Why Pelican?

There are many website static generators available on the internet, but I chose Pelican because from those written in Python it is the most popular one. That's it. So far so good.
