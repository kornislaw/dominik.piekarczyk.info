## Why a blog?

> I'm continuously learning (and sharing it when I got it).

This is my colleague's tagline, but I could just have the same one. 
This is one of three reasons I started this blog - I like sharing knowledge. 
It also helps me to memorize and systematize my knowledge and (which helped me several times already) to access it from anywhere.

I am not advertising this site at all, in fact this blog is now under a temporary domain, which is hard to memorize. But if you have just googled and answer for your issue - I am happy about it!

## Why a static website hosting?

See [S3 for static website hosting](/s3-for-static-website-hosting.html).


If you would like to know more about advantages of static websites generators, especially for Python, 
I advise you to listen to this podcast [Podcast.__init__: Episode 20 - Static Site Generators](http://podcastinit.com/static-site-generators.html), 
where authors of the most popular SWGs: Pelican and Nicola, discuss it in details.

## Why Pelican?

There are many website static generators available on the internet, but I chose Pelican because from those written in Python it is the most popular one. 
Active development, a vibrant community and many available plugins - it's convincing enough.
