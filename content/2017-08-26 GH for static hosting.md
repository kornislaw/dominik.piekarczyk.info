Currently I am running this blog on S3. But just out of curiosity I'd like to try how Pelican works with GitHub Pages.

So here it is.

## Zero costs

It is "Near zero costs" in case of S3, but with GHP it's even better. Until you keep your repository public, you don't pay anything for hosting.

## Setting up GHP

I assume you already are a registered user of GitHub.

`pip install ghp-import`
